# GILT - Generation-based Information-support with LLM Technology

GILT (Generation-based Information-support with LLM Technology) is a prototype in-IDE LLM information support tool.

## Requirements

To use GILT, you will need your own [OpenAI API key](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api).

## Features

### Prompt-less Trigger (Summary)

To trigger the tool, simply highlight a line of code and click on "AI Explanation" in the bottom blue bar or use the `alt/option` + `a` shortcut. On the left tab, you will find a summary description of the highlighted code. You can also trigger the tool by selecting the entire source code to see an overview of the entire source code.

### Prompt-less Trigger (Buttons)

You can click any of the three buttons (API, Concept, Usage) below the summary description to further engage the tool as many times as needed:

- The `API` button provides detailed explanations about the API calls used in the code.
- The `Concept` button introduces domain-specific concepts that are relevant to understanding the highlighted code.
- The `Usage` button offers code examples involving the API calls used in the highlighted code.

### User Prompts

You have the option to ask the AI model questions directly using the input box. For example, you can ask questions like "Where do I perform addition?" and click the `Ask` button or press `Enter`. You can also inquire about specific parts of the code by highlighting them and asking questions.

### Embed LLM-generated Information in Code

When you want to keep the information generated by the AI, simply use the `Embed` button. The AI-generated response will be added to the line before the highlighted code or before the cursor.

### Probe the LLM

If you don't select any part of your code, you can ask follow-up questions to further interact with the LLM. If you don't need to ask a follow-up question, you can simply click the `Clear All` button or trigger the tool with new code context.

### Collapse / Expand

You can collapse or expand previous information by clicking on the arrow icon next to the `Embed` button.

### Update OpenAI API Key

To update your OpenAI API Key:

1. Open the command palette with `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + p`.
2. Type `Update OpenAI API Key`.
3. Enter your new API Key into the prompt.
4. Reload the window.

To remove your OpenAI API Key:

1. Open the command palette with `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + p`.
2. Type `Update OpenAI API Key`.
3. Enter your API Key into the prompt.
4. Reload the window.

### Configurations

You can configure the LLM settings at `Settings` > `Extensions` > `GILT` (`Ctrl/Cmd + ,`).

Configurations that may be useful to adjust include:

- To use the GPT-4 model, set the `Chat Model` to `gpt-4`.
- The temperature controls how much randomness is in the output. The default value for GILT is `0.2`. Use `0` to make it produce the same output every time you ask the same question or increase it for more creativity.
- To allow GILT to incorporate longer context and prompts, increase the `Max Tokens`.
