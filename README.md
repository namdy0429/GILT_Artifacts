## Artifacts

Up-to-date artifacts are available here: [https://github.com/namdy0429/GILT_Artifacts](https://github.com/namdy0429/GILT_Artifacts)

There are two main components in this repository.

#### GILT (Generation-based Information-support with LLM Technology): [`/GILT_Artifacts/GILT`](https://github.com/namdy0429/GILT_Artifacts/tree/main/GILT)

How to install this plugin is included in [`/GILT_Artifacts/Install.md`](https://github.com/namdy0429/GILT_Artifacts/blob/main/INSTALL.md), and [`/GILT_Artifacts/GILT/overview.png`](https://github.com/namdy0429/GILT_Artifacts/blob/main/GILT/overview.png) and [`GILT_Artifacts/GILT/demo.mov`](https://github.com/namdy0429/GILT_Artifacts/blob/main/GILT/demo.mov) show how to use GILT.

#### Replication package for the user study analysis: [`/GILT_Artifacts/Study`](https://github.com/namdy0429/GILT_Artifacts/tree/main/study)

You can replicate the statistical analysis included in the paper by running [`/GILT_Artifacts/Study/analysis.ipynb`](https://github.com/namdy0429/GILT_Artifacts/blob/main/study/analysis.ipynb).

User study result data can be found [`/GILT_Artifacts/Study/study_data.csv`](https://github.com/namdy0429/GILT_Artifacts/blob/main/study/study_data.csv). 
[`/GILT_Artifacts/Install.md`](https://github.com/namdy0429/GILT_Artifacts/blob/main/INSTALL.md) describes how to set up R-Notebook environment to run this Notebook.
Study protocol and task designs are also included in [`/GILT_Artifacts/design/`](https://github.com/namdy0429/GILT_Artifacts/tree/main/study/design) and [`/GILT_Artifacts/tasks/`](https://github.com/namdy0429/GILT_Artifacts/tree/main/study/design/tasks).

## STATUS
We are applying for **Functional** and **Available** badges. The artifacts are made public and permanently archived. We also believe that the artifacts are well documented and easily exercisable by other researchers.
